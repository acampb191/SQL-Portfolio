#Alex Campbell's SQL Portfolio

Hello! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for various projects. Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualizations I created using Looker. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.


##Highlighted Projects
Chronic Pain Patient Identifier
  This SQL was written for a project showing Pain Product trends within the Veterinary Industry. There are two types of pain, Acute and Chronic. Acute being things like sprains, surgeries, infections etc. and chronic being osteoartritis or another disease. This SQL takes a patients purchasing data and uses it to determine whether the pain product they purchased was used for Chronic Pain. 

NSAID Switching
  This SQL was written for a project showing Pain Product trends within the Veterinary Industry. Chronic pain patients often switch between products to treat their pain. This query shows how long a patient was on a product before they switched and what they switched to.
